    <p>When the S3 integration is set up, Brightcove creates an AWS S3 bucket that Audience Insights reports are automatically exported to on a daily or weekly basis (depending on the setup). One or more AWS admins in the customer Brightcove account are given access to the S3 bucket and can grant access to other users so that they can review the reports.</p>
