  <p>When you set up an integration with S3, data reports are automatically exported to an S3 bucket called "reports.wicketlabs.com" and available to be viewed or downloaded from there.</p>

  {% if site.product_name == 'Audience Insights' %}
  <p>From Audience Insights, you can manually generate reports. If an S3 integration is set up, they can publish any of these reports to S3. You can also add users who can view/download the reports by applying the policy described below to other AWS users.</p>
  {% else %}
  <p>The reports will be exported to S3 on a daily or weekly basis, according to the schedule you set up, and will be available to those you designate by email addresses in the setup.</p>
