    <p>
        Each publishing integration has its own way of setting up publish properties.
    </p>
    <h3>S3</h3>
    <p>
        Wicket hosts a S3 bucket where reports end up. When they add an S3 integration in the UI, we set up our policy to grant them limited access to that S3 bucket. There is also a policy they need to add to their AWS users so that they can access our bucket.
    </p>
    <p>There is no need to set up properties for an S3 export, since the CSV file is copied over as-is.</p>
    <h3>Salesforce, Hubspot, Eloqua, and Sailthru</h3>
    <p>
        Properties are stored in the dynamo table <strong>ENV-customer-publish-integrations</strong>.  The publish integrations UI (from scorecard or videocloud) has an Integration Properties tab on which the properties can be selected and saved automatically in the dynamo table.
