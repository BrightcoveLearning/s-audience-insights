  <p>The Viewing by Day Part graph shows the local time viewers consumed content, grouped by the time of day when the view occurred. If a view stretches across multiple day parts, that view is counted in each of the day parts it spans.</p>

  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <p>Select one of the following to display data in the graph:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Video Views</strong> - Estimated number of video views</li>
      <li><strong>Audience Size</strong> - Estimated number of viewers</li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Video views and audience size values are estimated based on random viewer sampling. For viewer populations of more than 30,000, statistics are projected from a random sample of viewer behavior. Using 30,000 viewers ensures a margin of error of less than 1%.</aside>
